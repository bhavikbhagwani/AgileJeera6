## Python Installation üõ†Ô∏è
Check that you have the latest version of Python 3 installed

## MAKE AND MAKEFILE

We recommend working with the MakeFile so make sure you have 'make' installed in your machine
If not installed see video on how to install:

by Mikael Roos

The Makefile contains a target to execute or run several commands.

## Cloning App and Terminal

We encourage you to play in Git Bash as a terminal. 
With the terminal navigate to the location you want the game in and execute this command:

    git clone https://github.com/bhavikbhagwani/AgileJeera6.git



Go into the src directory:

    cd src 

## SETTING VENV

Once having 'make' installed, first of all you need to set the virtual environment and activate it. 
(Make sure you are in the AgileJeera6/ directory)
You can set a virtual environment using 

            make venv

Then, you should activate the virtual environment using

            . .venv/Scripts/activate

You should see a (.venv) in your terminal
This will allow all features to be found and run
You can later deactivate the virtual environment by using

            deactivate

For Windows start the venv with:

    . .venv/Scripts/activate

For Unix and Macs start it with:

    .venv/bin/activate

Install the needed dependencies using: 

    make install

This will also install pygame and pyrebase, two important
dependancies that are required for the application to run


## To run the application ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
The MakeFile provides a command for running the application, by typing:

The application can be initialized in two ways:
One way is by executing the 'app.py' file in the src directory:

    cd src
    python app.py

or outside the src directory:

    python src/app.py

Another way is by using the MakeFile. The MakeFile provides a
command for running the application, by typing:

    make start

## Cleanup üßπ

To clean up generated and installed files, use the following commands:

    make clean

To clean up documentation files:

    make clean-doc

To clean up source files:

    make clean-src

To clean up everything:

    make clean-all

## Testing ‚úÖ
Testing is done inside the src folder

    cd src

For running unit tests you can type:

    make unittest

You can run linters using

        make lint

or separetaly using

        make flake8         make pylint

You can also analyse the code from a security perspective to see
any security flaws on the code using. Do this inside the src folder using:

    make bandit

## Documentation üìÑ
Documentation is done inside the src folder

    cd src
    
Documentation is a helpful feature to help understand the code for other developers
First of all install the 'dot' command  to help generate the UML diagrams from the source code
For windows, you can do it through chocolatey in Powershell as administrator:

        choco install graphviz

For mac OS, through the 'brew' package manager.

        brew install graphviz

Debian (and other Linux), through your package manager.

        apt install graphviz

After the installation is done you can check what version you got.

        $ dot -V

To generate UML diagrams you can just type

        make pyreverse

This will generate UML diagrams inside doc/pyreverse
Note: the UML diagrams will involve all files inside the src folder.
We have two ways of storing the app:
One where eveything is in one file, excluding the Database class
Another where the classes are separated into modules, except the Pages

To view the accurate UML arquitecture of the app, there is an image in
the directory called 'aumeter_UML.png' which you can view
