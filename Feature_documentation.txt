Tracking user activity and session duration in a desktop application is typically done through event tracking and session management.

Event Tracking: 
    Implement event tracking within your application to record user actions and interactions. 
    These events could include actions like opening the application, viewing specific content, interacting with UI elements, 
    and closing the application.

Session Management: 
    Track sessions by recording the start time when the user logs in or opens the 
    application and the end time when the user logs out or closes the application. 
    You can also consider tracking idle time (periods where the user is not actively interacting with the application) separately.

Data Storage: 
    Store the recorded events and session data locally on the user's device. 
    This could involve using a database, local storage, or other persistent storage mechanisms.
    Calculation of Session Duration: Calculate the session duration by subtracting the start time 
    from the end time for each session. You can aggregate this data to get insights into the average session duration, 
    total time spent by users, etc.

Reporting and Analysis: 
    Use the recorded data for reporting and analysis purposes. This could involve generating reports, visualizing user activity patterns, 
    identifying trends, and making data-driven decisions to improve the user experience.


Identifying the Events I want to Track: 
Determining which user interactions or events I want to track to measure time spent on the application. 
These could include:
    -Application launch
    -Application exit or close
    -User login/logout
    -Switching between different screens or sections
    -Interaction with key features or functionality
    -Inactivity or idle time
